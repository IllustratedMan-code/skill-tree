* Skill Tree
The aim behind this project is to create a static site generator for a personal wiki. This wiki should have a landing page that visualizes the content of the wiki as a graph in two ways. The first should be a graph based on the link relationships between wiki pages. The second should be a "skill tree" of prerequisite knowledge for each page. This will be defined in each page in some way.
